AWS Graviton processors are custom built by Amazon Web Services using 64-bit Arm Neoverse cores to deliver the best price performance 
for your cloud workloads running in Amazon EC2. Amazon EC2 provides the broadest and deepest portfolio of compute instances, 
including many that are powered by latest-generation Intel and AMD processors. AWS Graviton processors add even more choice to 
help customers optimize performance and cost for their workloads.

AWS Graviton2 processors deliver a major leap in performance and capabilities over first-generation AWS Graviton processors. 
They power Amazon EC2 T4g, M6g, C6g, and R6g instances, and their variants with local NVMe-based SSD storage, 
that provide up to 40% better price performance over comparable current generation x86-based instances1 for a wide variety of workloads, 
including application servers, micro-services, high-performance computing, electronic design automation, gaming, open-source databases, 
and in-memory caches. The AWS Graviton2 processors also provide enhanced performance for video encoding workloads, hardware acceleration for compression workloads, and support for CPU-based machine learning inference. They deliver 7x more performance, 4x more compute cores, 5x faster memory, and 2x larger caches.
